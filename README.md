# MeetingPets
Social network for your pets!

Hi everybody!

Here we have a new SpringBoot project. The goal of this project is to learn about SpringBoot codification always trying to use the best practises in it. Moreover, we will try to organice our code by the best way.

This project is like a social network for pets. So we will try to connect that people who want to match their pets or simply their pets need the companionship of other new friends.

I hope this projects can help to other people for understanding and beginnig to use SpringBoot framework.

Thank you all!
